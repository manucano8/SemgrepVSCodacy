# SemgrepVSCodacy
This repository contains four code fragments referenced in the paper 'Comparative Review of Semgrep and Codacy in Static Application Security Testing (SAST)', which will be presented in the [Fourth Doctoral Consortium in Computer Science (JIPII 2024)](https://jipii.uca.es/).

The code fragments were extracted from two public intentionally vulnerable repositories:

- "XXEInjection.java" and "SSRF.java" were extracted from [https://github.com/malikashish8/vuln-spring](https://github.com/malikashish8/vuln-spring).
- "CommandInjection.py" and "SQLInjection.py" were extracted from [https://github.com/sgabe/DSVPWA](https://github.com/sgabe/DSVPWA)
